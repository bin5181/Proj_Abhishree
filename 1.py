                                     # Testing CSV File:
# 1/ It looks like the scraper is successfully reading and storing the necessary information from theverge.com. However, there are a few things that should be addressed:

# 2/ There is a typo in the EmmaRoth author field of the first article. It should be Emma Roth.
# 3/ The date field should be formatted as dd/mm/yyyy, but it is currently formatted as yyyy/mm/dd. This should be fixed.
# 4/ There is a whitespace after the comma in the URL of the first article. This should be removed.
# 5/ Other than these minor issues, the CSV file looks correct and properly formatted.


                                     # Test Cases:
# Here are some test cases to catch potential bugs:

# 1/ Test case to check for duplicate articles:
# Create two articles with the same URL and run the scraper. Check if the CSV and SQLite database have only one entry for that article.

# 2/ Test case to check for invalid URLs:
# Create an invalid URL (e.g. "https://www.google") and run the scraper. Check if the script handles the error gracefully and continues scraping other articles.

# 3/ Test case to check for missing article data:
# Create an article without a headline, author or date and run the scraper. Check if the script can handle missing data and still store the article in the CSV and SQLite database.

# 4/ Test case to check for missing CSV file:
# Delete the CSV file before running the scraper. Check if the script can handle the missing file and create a new one with the correct header and data.

# 5/ Test case to check for missing SQLite table:
# Delete the SQLite table before running the scraper. Check if the script can handle the missing table and create a new one with the correct schema and data.
